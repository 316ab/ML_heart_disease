# Comprehensive-Machine-Learning-Full-Pipeline-on-Heart-Disease-UCI-Dataset
This ML project aims to analyze/predict heart disease risks. It covers data preprocessing, PCA, feature selection, supervised/unsupervised modeling, optimization, and deployment via Streamlit, Ngrok, and GitHub. Python is the primary tool used.
## objectives 
To analyze, predict, and visualize heart disease risks through data preprocessing, feature selection, PCA, supervised classification (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM), unsupervised clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering), model optimization, and deployment via Streamlit, Ngrok, and GitHub.
## Used tools 
Tools to be used include Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Specific methods include PCA, RFE, Chi-Square Test, GridSearchCV, and RandomizedSearchCV, alongside Streamlit, Ngrok, and GitHub for deployment.
